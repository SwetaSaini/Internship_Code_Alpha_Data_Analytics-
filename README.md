# Internship_Code_Alpha_Data_Analytics-
CodeAlpha Data Analytics project: Indian Literacy Rate Analysis. Used Python (Pandas, BS4, Seaborn) for E2E analysis: web scraping, data cleaning, and EDA. Main focus: calculating and visualizing the Male-Female Literacy Gender Gap to highlight educational disparities across states. See charts for Top/Bottom performers.
# CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship: Indian Literacy Rate Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is a complete, end-to-end data analysis study focusing on the distribution and disparities in **Literacy Rates across Indian States and Union Territories**.

The primary objective was to demonstrate proficiency in the full data analytics lifecycle, from raw data acquisition to delivering clear, actionable insights.

### Core Focus: The Gender Gap

The central analytical task was calculating and visualizing the **Gender Gap** in literacy (the difference between Male and Female Literacy Rates) to highlight regions with the highest and lowest educational inequalities.

## Key Tasks & Technologies

### 1. Data Acquisition (Web Scraping)

* **Tools:** Python (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`)
* **Method:** Scraped relevant tabular data on literacy rates from a public web source (Wikipedia).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Tool:** Pandas
* **Method:**
    * **Data Cleaning:** Handled messy data (footnotes and text strings) and converted all literacy percentage columns into the correct numerical (`float`) type.
    * **Feature Engineering:** Calculated the **`Gender Gap`** column.
    * **Analysis:** Identified the top 3 states by overall literacy rate, and the states with the highest/lowest calculated gender gaps.

### 3. Data Visualization

* **Tools:** Matplotlib & Seaborn
* **Output:** Generated two insightful bar charts to communicate findings effectively.

** Key Takeaways**

The project successfully identifies and visually presents the significant variance in the literacy gender gap across India, providing a clear basis for further policy or social analysis.
